This module is a partial implementation of the Hessian binary protocol.
Hessian is a compact binary protocol for cross-platform web services and 
messaging.  It allows you to represent binary data (integers, floats, lists
objects, etc.) in a very compact form.  This allows storage or communication
to be small and fast. 

This is only a partial implementation of the Hessian protocol.  It implements 
Hessian serialization and is based on Hessian 2.0 Draft Specification at 
  http://caucho.com/resin-3.1/doc/hessian-2.0-spec.xtp

TBD:
  Implement the Hessian standard rather than the draft.
  Implement more of the defined types
